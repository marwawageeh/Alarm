# ⏰ Smart Alarm – Python Project (2023)

This is a personal project I created in 2023 during my second year at university.  
The main idea was to build a **smart alarm** using Python that not only rings at a set time, but also takes further steps to make sure the user actually wakes up! 🚀

## 💡 Project Idea

The user enters the desired wake-up time. When the time comes:

1. The alarm rings using a sound file.
2. If the user doesn't stop it after a certain period:
   - It **automatically makes a phone call** to the user.
   - It **sends an SMS message** to alert them.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Language:** Python 🐍
- Libraries:
  - `datetime` for time management
  - `playsound` to play the alarm sound
  - `twilio` to send SMS and make phone calls (requires a Twilio account)
    
## ✨ Features

- Real-time interactive alarm
- Backup alert via phone call and SMS
- Simple and user-friendly input
- Great for deep sleepers who ignore normal alarms 😴
